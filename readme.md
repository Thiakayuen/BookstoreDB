## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench or similar database management tool
- Basic understanding of SQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open MySQL and create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
   USE bookstore;
   ```
3. Run the `bookstore.sql` script to create all tables and sample data
4. Run the `bookstore_queries.sql` script to test the database with example queries

## Example Queries
The project includes a comprehensive set of example queries demonstrating various features:

1. **Inventory Management**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.title, b.quantity, b.minimum_stock_level
   FROM books b
   WHERE b.quantity <= b.minimum_stock_level;
   ```

2. **Customer Loyalty Program**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.loyalty_points, c.membership_level
   FROM customer c
   ORDER BY c.loyalty_points DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Sales Analysis**
   ```sql
   SELECT bc.category_name,
          COUNT(DISTINCT ol.order_id) AS total_orders,
          SUM(ol.quantity) AS total_books_sold
   FROM book_category bc
   JOIN books b ON bc.id = b.category_id
   JOIN order_line ol ON b.id = ol.book_id
   GROUP BY bc.id;
   ```

## Security Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure payment information storage
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Access control for different user roles

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper indexing for performance optimization
- Referential integrity with foreign keys
- Data validation and constraints
- Normalized database design
- Comprehensive error handling
